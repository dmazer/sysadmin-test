Disaster Recovery Design and Verification
=========================================
Answer the following questions immediately below each question.

Q1) Disaster Recovery and Continuous Operations
-----------------------------------------------
What is the relationship between DR and COOP? What are the driving factors
pertaining to this type of planning?

DR is the process or procedure developed by a company or organization to provide/initiate computer/network system recovery continuity;
COOP is the federal initiative for DR, with specific guidelines for compliance coupled with DR.

Q2) Disaster Recovery Planning
------------------------------
How do DNS, layer-4 switches and layer-7 logic relate to DR situations? What
is a transparent failure?

With DNS, in a DR scenario where a failover moves to the backup data center, changes must also be made to DNS to redirect traffic.

A transparent failure is a hardware or software failure in a data center which is resolved and the end users are unaware of such a failure.

Q3) Disaster Recovery Practice
------------------------------
How does production deployment relate to DR? Describe the concerns with
reverting a production deployment.

The main concern is loss of service and connectivity for clients.  Reverting a production deployment involves a temporary stoppage of service with the least possible downtime, to restore the previous working deployment.  Hopefully, a fully tested procedure is in place with such a practice.

Q4) DR Scenario
---------------
You have a production site with a partial service-capacity, replicated back-up
site. The primary and back-up sites are connected with a direct fiber backplane
for fail-over and consistency communication. Someone hits the fiber with a
backhoe. Is this an issue? If it is, how would you design the total system to
mitigate any problems?

The best possible design for this situation is to have all systems replicated in another data center, with a heartbeat mechanism in place to initiate a failover.  A series of tests (scripted) would execute to ensure there is a true outage, before initiating the failover.  This can be done manually (with alerts in place) or automatically.

All databases and system files would be replicated/sync'ed to the alternate data center, which is basically a duplicate environment.

If a fiber link is cut, most likely the data is not compromised, but that fiber link may be the only network route to the data center.

External Connectivity
=====================
Our production assets require high-availability to external resources as the
information gathered is time-sensitive and missed results may not be
recoverable.

Q1) Heart-beat Check
====================
Include in this directory a script which verifies that a given IP address is
not blacklisted from any public IRC service.

see blacklist_check.sh

Q2) Feedback
============
Describe how you would ensure timely feedback in the event that an asset in
production is blacklisted.

The blacklist_check.sh script can be used to provide an alert or alarm.  For example in Nagios monitoring, it can be further customized as a plugin which exits with a return value (>0) to generate an alarm.

Q3) Enterprise Integration
==========================
How would you ensure connectivity between an order-processing asset and an
external credit card processing system? If you have never worked with such
a system, describe another enterprise integration issue from your experience.

The link must be over an SSL connection, encrypted, using https, etc.   Since this is a critical application, there must be constant monitoring of this link with major or critical alarms/alerts generated if there's any blip or interruption of this connection.

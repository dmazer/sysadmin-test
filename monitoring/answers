Production Monitoring
=====================

Q1) A service is repeatedly crashing. How do you identify possible causes?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A service can crash because a disk is full, a file system not mounted, network connection is unavailable, load is too high;  Many times a service depends on another service which may not be running, or may just need to be restarted.  All these need to be checked.

Q2) Scenario:
-------------
Given a collection of internal assets which are partitioned into several classes where each class runs a distinct set of services. Network structure is such that two nodes of different classes may not be able to directly communicate. One class of nodes is for data aggregation and another integrates to an external enterprise peer. There is a message bus for passing work between classes.

Describe in bullet points how you would monitor such a system. Include a set of health metrics and targets.

- From one network node, run a monitoring script which checks connectivity to the other node and vice versa.  Alert on the return values from the scripts.
- If it's possible to obtain useful data from the message bus, that can also be scripted to alert if, for example, there's no data at all passing between the classes, or if there's a time-lapse threshold (no data throughput for 5 minutes) or high latency, e.g., greater than 200ms.


Q3) In Linux, how do you identify what resources a given process has?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
lsof | grep <PID> -- look for file names the process is associated with
netstat -plantu | grep <PID> -- look for running application after ESTABLISHED

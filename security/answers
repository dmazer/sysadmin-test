Security
========

Q1) What is SSL?
----------------
SSL= Secure Socket Layer.

Q2) What is the sudoers file? What is its purpose?
--------------------------------------------------
The /etc/sudoers file contains the list of users allowed to run the sudo command, so that an admin does not have to become root.  It makes it easier to either prompt for a first-time use user password, or run sudo with no password at all, based on the directives set in sudoers.

Also, it can be set to restrict a user to only run one or several specific commands as root.

Q3) Compare and contrast password, key and certificate authentication.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
As in the case of VPNs, a CA is required which overrides having to enter a password to access a secure remote system.  The CA adds another level of security over encrypted connections.

With keys, as in ssh public/private keys, accessing servers with no password is accomplished by adding the user's public key (generated by ssh-keygen) to the allowed hosts/authorized_keys file on the remote server.  The keys in the files are checked for a match based on user and machine name.

Q4) How do you enable certificate authentication in Apache?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Edit the /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf file and add the SSLRequireSSL directive:


Q5) How do you handle a leaked key?
-----------------------------------
Revoke the compromised public key certificate and add it the CA certificate revocation list (CRL).
